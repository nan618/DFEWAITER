o Why do we do this?
I am learning in QA Virtual Online Classroom for 9 weeks and I need this project to demonstrate my knowledge.
    The project is Spring Boot API, the function is to create the waiter information and can read all, read one, update, and delete information. It consumes and can process data from Postman and includes a relational database to hold the project's data. It can show that data has been saved to a database using tools like MySQL Workbench. I use Git as a version control system and GitHub to host my code repository and use Jira to track my projects.

o What are my expectations for the challenge?
Using Jira for me is a new thing, I knew Jira allows you to authorize project admins to add or remove users, but I do not know how to do it. I search google and found the solution.

oWhat is going well? / What didn't go according to plan?
The project is Spring Boot API going well. However, my computer has defects because I could not hear anything from the online class on Thursday. I had repaired it, but it made me slow down.

o Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
    In the future, I will implement hierarchical management permissions. For example, waiter self-management (it just does self-information), administrator management (it does some information), manager management (it does all information)

o Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
